# LBLD-algorithm
Local Balanced Label Diffusion Algorithm for Community Detection in Social Networks

This code implements LBLD algorithm, a fast and non-overlapping community detection algorithm in Python 3.7.

We have used neighboring list structure as the input file for algorithm. The execution of the LBLD is so simple.it is only needed to write the name of the dataset to run the algorithm.

Everything is built to run the algorithm (such as pathes to folders and files) and it is only needed to execute algorithm using jupyter notebook or any other platform to which runs python


Names of datasets are as follows and are available in "datasets" folder.
