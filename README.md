# LBLD-algorithm
Local Balanced Label Diffusion Algorithm for Community Detection in Social Networks

This code implements LBLD algorithm in Python 3.7.

we have used neighboring list structure as the input file for algorithm.
the execution of the LBLD is so simple.it is only needed to write the name of the dataset to run the algorithm.

Datasets names can be selected from the "datasets" folder.
Everything is built to run the algorithm (pathes to folders and files) and it is only needed to execute algorithm using jupyter note book or other any platform to run python
